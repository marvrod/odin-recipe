        <p>Ever wanted to know how to cook a Chicken Taco Lasagna? Me neither. Here's how.</p>

        You'll gonna need:
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li> 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1/4-inch strips</li>

        <li>  ½ cup lime juice</li>

        <li>  2 (1 ounce) packets taco seasoning mix (such as Old El Paso®)</li>

        <li> 1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>

        <li> 1 cup sour cream</li>

        <li> 1 cup salsa</li>

        <li> salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

        <li> 1 (8 ounce) package no-boil lasagna noodles, or to taste</li>

        </ul>
        
        <ol>
        <li>
            Combine chicken, lime juice, 
            and taco seasoning in a large bowl. Stir to make sure chicken is 
            evenly covered.
