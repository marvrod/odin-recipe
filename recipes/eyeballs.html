        <h1>Spooky Halloween Eyeballs</h1>
        <h5>Totally not from https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/180504/spooky-halloween-eyeballs/</h5>
        
        <p>So we made a recipe for edible eyeballs. We're clearly out of ideas.</p>

        You'll gonna need:
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li> 1 ½ cups creamy peanut butter</li>

        <li>  ½ cup butter, softened</li>

        <li>  2 ½ cups confectioners' sugar, sifted</li>

        <li> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>

        <li> 12 ounces white chocolate, chopped</li>

        <li> 2 tablespoons shortening</li>

        <li> 2 drops blue food coloring</li>

        <li> ½ cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips</li>

        </ul>
        
        <ol>
        <li>
            Beat the peanut butter and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the sugar and vanilla. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Roll chilled dough into small, eyeball-sized
             balls and place on 2 baking sheets lined with wax paper. Refrigerate for another 30 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Melt the white chocolate and shortening in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second 
            intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). 
            Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Dip each eyeball into the white chocolate
            and transfer to the waxed paper until the chocolate has set. You can chill them in 
            the refrigerator.
        </li>

        <li>
            Stir a few drops of blue food coloring into the remaining melted white chocolate. 
            Make a round "iris" on the top of the cooled eyeball and press a mini chocolate chip in the center for 
            a "pupil."
        </li>

        </ol>
           <p> <strong>Congratulations! You should now have edible eyeballs. Amazing.</strong></p>
    <p>Suffice to say they should look like this. Glasses not included:</p>
